## Data Viz Summary 
The visualization shows active shooter incidents from 2000 to 2015. Previously in the chapter, they showed how shooting incidents have increased. This image shows which year had the most shooting incidents, which points to 2010. It's important to point out that in 2000, there was only 1 incident reported and the numbers remain fairly low until around 2009 when the numbers begin to increase significantly. This is an example of data that was used positively, to support a cause and aid a very prevalent issue still to this day, communicating that something has to be done to reduce these numbers.  
"Here, plainness is equated with the absence of design and thus greater freedom on the part of the viewer to interpret the results for themselves. " Data Feminism ch.3 ![](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/5evfe9yd/release/5?readingCollection=0cd867ef)
